# zapakuj.to

I worked at [zapakuj.to](http://zapakuj.to) as a junior front-end developer. My main task was to build their homepage.
It is a static website presenting the company.

I was also given some tasks regarding [the box creator web app](https://kreator.zapakuj.to). In order to help with that I needed to quickly understand and learn the basics of ReactJS.
