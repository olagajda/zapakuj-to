# zapakuj.to

I worked at a Warsaw-based start-up [zapakuj.to](http://zapakuj.to) as a junior front-end developer. My main task was to build their first homepage.
It was a static website presenting the company.

I was also given some tasks regarding the box creator web app. In order to help with that I needed to quickly understand and learn the basics of ReactJS and ES6.
